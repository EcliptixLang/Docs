## Prequisites

To install Ecliptix on your device, you first need to have:

- [Node.js: The server runtime for JavaScript](https://nodejs.org)
- [npm: The node package manager](https://npmjs.com)

Firstly check if they're correctly installed by using:

```bash
$ npm -v
10.8.2
$ node -v
v22.5.1
```

The version numbers may differ but that doesn't usually cause any issues.

## Installation

You can install Ecliptix by using:

```bash
npm i ecliptix -g
```

After it's done, you can check your version by running

```bash
$ ecx -v
webwise Ecliptix version 0.0.5
```
