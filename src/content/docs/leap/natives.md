description: Understanding the Ecliptix Natives Subsystem

## What is this?

Ecliptix Natives are simple, they're just a list of system functions and methods available to you through the `proj.yml` file!

## Why do natives exist?

Well, since Ecliptix is a safe language, we don't want people playing around with critical system components, so natives are meant to be a way of preventing that and keeping everything safe :D

## What are the available natives?

Currently, the only available natives are:
- the packages

We're updating this, so stay tuned :D
